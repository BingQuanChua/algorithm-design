# Algorithm-Design
Algorithm Design and Analysis Assignment

## Assignment 1

In Assignment 1, we generated a few sets of emails and stored them into different data structures. We recorded the time taken for storing and searching the emails in each data structures. _algo-design-1_ consists of 5 different programs:
1. Email Generator
2. Hash Table with Chaining
3. Hash Table with Linear Probing 
4. AVL Binary Search Tree
5. Priority Queue and Heap 



## Assignment 2

In Assignment 2, we are required to analyze planet data according to this map:

algo-design-2 consists of 4 different programs:

1. Planet Data Generator
2. Planet Edges and Value with Merge-Sort
3. Dijakstra's Algorithm to find Shortest Paths
4. Kruskal's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree
